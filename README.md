# template

A quick template for starting new generative art sketches.

**Goals:**
1. Allow me to quickly experiment with new ideas (I'll call these sketches), regardless of technology
2. Evolve as my process evolves
3. Let me edit/tune parameters on the fly as I go (vs hardcoding everything)

**Non-Goal:**
* Create production-ready art

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create your new js file (copy `/public/js/template.js`) 
4. Start the auto-updating runtime `npm run dev`
5. View your work: http://localhost:3000
